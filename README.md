# Monopoly Money Tracker App

## Summary:
This web app is a solution to a problem I was facing when playing monopoly: disorganized money! Using this app replaces the need for monopoly and does all the calculating for you!

## How To Use:

### Setup:

1. To begin first select the number of players you wish to have (2 - 8). 

2. You will be prompted to enter their names and their corresponding piece of choice.

3. You can then accept the default starting amount of $1500 or set a custom starting amount.

### Home Screen

The home screen shows information for each player. This includes: how much money they have in the bank, how much money they have invested in property, and their net worth. 

You will also see action buttons for the following: passing Go (collect $200), Rent (when landing on another player's property), Buy (for buying new property), Sell (for selling property you own), and trade (for trading property values with another player). Please see below for more detailed instructions.

### `Go`

### `Rent`

### `Buy`
